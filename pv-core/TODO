This file contains a list of items to do.

Get rid of Channel_Type enum and instead use preprocessor directives if needed

More graceful aborting from errors under mpi.  There's a pv_log but it's preprocessor directived to fprintf

Add ffmpeg support

PatternState.bin and .txt should only write the stuff being used

Movie should be able to use autoResizeFlag when reading a PVP file (currently only does so for GDAL files)

Get rid of LayerDataInterface, and have HyPerLayer and HyPerConn be derived from a HyPerObject layer

Start using TODO list
