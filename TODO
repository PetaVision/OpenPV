This file contains a list of items to do.

Get rid of Channel_Type enum and instead use preprocessor directives if needed

Weight .pvp files shouldn't depend on the mpi configuration being used when writing.

Eliminate need for marginWidth parameter

Each neuron (& weight?) its own reproducible rng (layer and conn can specify a seedIncrement) (done for retina and lif)

No more activity buffer; things that write to activity only write to DataStore

More graceful aborting from errors under mpi.  There's a pv_log but it's preprocessor directived to fprintf

Add ffmpeg support

PatternState.bin and .txt only writes the stuff being used

 * params.pv should be params.xml, and include all parameters

Use cmake to manage makefiles (done for PetaVision and some system tests)
