This file contains a list of items to do.

Kernel connections should be set using a HyPerConn member variable flag, as opposed to a separate class hierarchy

Get rid of Channel_Type enum and instead use preprocessor directives if needed

Weight .pvp files shouldn't depend on the mpi configuration being used when writing.

No more activity buffer; things that write to activity should only write to DataStore

More graceful aborting from errors under mpi.  There's a pv_log but it's preprocessor directived to fprintf

Add ffmpeg support

PatternState.bin and .txt should only write the stuff being used

DONE! -- params.pv should be pv.params, and include all parameters that were set to default values and exclude all parameters that were ignored.

read[ParameterName] should be io[ParameterName] and have a write/!read flag; each io[ParameterName] should contain documentation for that parameter
(this is so that pv.params will be automatically maintained as parameters are added)

CloneKernelConn doesn't need to write checkpoints since it's a clone; make sure that pointers are set correctly when reading checkpoints.  Similarly, is writeStep needed for clones?

Movie should be able to use autoResizeFlag when reading a PVP file (currently only does so for GDAL files)

Get rid of LayerDataInterface, and have HyPerLayer and HyPerConn be derived from a HyPerObject layer

Add an option to specify a wall clock frequency for checkpointing

pvdata_t should be split into pvweight_t and pvactivity_t, perhaps also pvgsyn_t and pvpotential_t; provide support for varying precisions

When reading from a checkpoint, should specify directory (Checkpoint[n] or Last) on command line instead of needing to mangle the params file
