{"name":"Openpv","tagline":"Open-sourced Accelerated Neuromorphic Computing ","body":"# What is PetaVision?\r\nPetaVision is an open source, object oriented neural simulation toolbox optimized for high-performance multi-core, multi-node computer architectures. PetaVision is intended for computational neuroscientists who seek to apply neuromorphic models to hard signal processing problems; both to improve on the performance of existing algorithms and/or to gain insight into the computational mechanisms underlying biological neural processing.\r\n\r\n## Core PetaVision Features:\r\n* Open-sourced and developer-friendly\r\n* C/C++ for fast execution and OOP\r\n* Optimized for parallelization (OpenMP, MPI, cuDNN)\r\n* Based on local connectivity\r\n* Experiments defined through a text file\r\n\r\n## How has PetaVision been used?\r\nPetavision has been used on a range of vision and learning tasks including depth inference, action classification, and learning from multiple intelligence streams including weather and commodity prices. PetaVision has been used to perform image classification, sound analysis, and image-rescaling and is flexible enough to grow with your imagination.\r\n","google":"UA-65562349-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
