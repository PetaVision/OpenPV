# Projects

The Projects repository at <https://github.com/PetaVision/Projects>
contains projects that use the OpenPV library.  Each directory in the
repository is an independent project. 

ExampleProject serves as a starting point for using CMake to build an
executable that uses OpenPV.  Because this is a starting point for other
projects, we will start by copying the ExampleProject directory to a new
location, outside of the OpenPV repository.  We will denote the location of
the copy by $SOURCEDIR.

    cp -r "$OPENPVDIR/cmake/ExampleProject" "$SOURCEDIR"

We will also need to create a build directory to hold the executable binary,
output files, etc, and run ccmake from within this directory.  We will denote
the path to this directory by $BUILDDIR.

    mkdir "$BUILDDIR"
    cd "$BUILDDIR"
    ccmake "$SOURCEDIR"

Once ccmake starts, press [c] to configure.
There will be an error message unless the default OpenPV directory location
agrees with the location of OpenPV on your system.  If you get an error,
press [e] to exit the error message screen.

In the ccmake GUI, set the following variables:
CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE: either Debug or Release
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX: leave as the default value
PV_SOURCE_DIR: Change to the path to the OpenPV repository.

Once you've changed the variables, press [c] to configure again.  All
the CMake variables defined by OpenPV and the packages it uses will appear.
Edit these variables as desired
(see <https://github.com/PetaVision/OpenPV/wiki/PetaVision-CMake-Variables>
for a description of the most important variables).

You'll need to press [c] to configure a few times, until the option
[g] to generate the makefile appears.  Then press [g] to generate and exit.
Then, run the makefile:

    make

The OpenPV library is placed into $BUILDDIR/OpenPV/lib.  The system tests
are installed into $BUILDDIR/OpenPV/tests (unless you turned
PV_BUILD_TEST off).  The executable is in either the Debug or the Release
directory, depending on how you set CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE, and has the same
name as the basename of $SOURCEDIR.

To run the executable (replace "Debug" with "Release", and ExampleProject
with the name you chose, if needed):

    Debug/ExampleProject -p input/ExampleProject.params -t 1

The example params file has one input layer and one output layer, and
writes the output to output/Output.pvp.  To load this file into python:

python
>>> import os, sys
>>> sys.path.append(os.path.abspath("/path/to/OpenPV/python"))
>>> import pvtools
>>> outdata = pvtools.readpvpfile("output/Output.pvp")

See <view-source:https://github.com/PetaVision/OpenPV/wiki/Python-PV-Tools#readpvpfile>
for a description of the format of outdata.
