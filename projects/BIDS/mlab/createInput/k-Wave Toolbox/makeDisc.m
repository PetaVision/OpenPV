function disc = makeDisc(Nx, Ny, cx, cy, radius, plot_disc)
%MAKEDISC   Create a binary map of a filled disc within a 2D grid.
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%       makeDisc creates a binary map of a filled disc within a
%       two-dimensional grid (the disc position is denoted by 1's in the
%       matrix with 0's elsewhere). A single grid point is taken as the
%       disc centre thus the total diameter of the disc will always be an
%       odd number of grid points. As the returned disc has a constant
%       radius, if used within a k-Wave grid where dx ~= dy, the disc will
%       appear oval shaped. If part of the disc overlaps the grid edge, the
%       rest of the disc will wrap to the grid edge on the opposite side.  
%
% USAGE:
%       disc = makeDisc(Nx, Ny, cx, cy, radius)
%       disc = makeDisc(Nx, Ny, cx, cy, radius, plot_disc)
%
% INPUTS:
%       Nx, Ny          - size of the 2D grid [grid points]
%       cx, cy          - centre of the disc [grid points]
%       radius          - disc radius [grid points]
%
% OPTIONAL INPUTS:
%       plot_disc       - Boolean controlling whether the disc is plotted
%                         using imagesc (default = false)
%
% OUTPUTS:
%       disc            - 2D binary map of a filled disc
