function pml = getPML(Nx, dx, dt, c, pml_size, pml_alpha, staggered, dimension)
%GETPML   Return the PML variable.
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%       getPML returns a 1D perfectly matched layer variable based on the
%       given size and absorption coefficient.
%
% USAGE:
%       pml = getPML(Nx, pml_size, pml_alpha)
%
% INPUTS:
%       Nx          - grid size [grid points]
%       dx          - grid spacing [m]
%       dt          - time spacing [s]
%       c           - sound speed [m/s]
%       pml_size    - size of the PML on each side of the grid [grid points]
%       pml_alpha   - absorption coefficient [Nepers/m]
%       staggered   - boolean controlling whether the grid is staggered
%       dimension   - direction of the pml vector (1, 2, or 3)

% pml_right = pml_alpha*(c/dx)* ( (x - 1) ./ (pml_size - 1) ).^2;
% Staggered grid equivalents:

% pml_right = pml_alpha*(c/dx)* ( ((x + 0.5) - 1) ./ (pml_size - 1) ).^2;
