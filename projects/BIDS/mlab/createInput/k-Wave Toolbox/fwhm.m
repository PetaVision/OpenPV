function fwhm_val = fwhm(f, x, plot_fwhm)
%FWHM   Compute the full width at half maximum.
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%       fwhm calculates the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of a
%       positive 1D input function f(x) with spacing given by x.
%
% USAGE:
%       fwhm_val = fwhm(f, x)
%       fwhm_val = fwhm(f, x, plot_fwhm)
%
% INPUTS:
%       f           - f(x) data
%       x           - x data or dx
%
% OPTIONAL INPUTS:
%       plot_fwhm   - Boolean controlling whether a plot of the function
%                     and FWHM is produced.
%
% OUTPUTS:
%       fwhm_val    - FWHM of f(x)
