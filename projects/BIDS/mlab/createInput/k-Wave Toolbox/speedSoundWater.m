function c = speedSoundWater(T)
%SPEEDSOUNDWATER   Calculate the speed of sound in water with temperature.
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%       speedSoundWater calculates the speed of sound in distilled water at
%       a given temperature using the 5th order polynomial given by
%       Marczak. 
%
% USAGE:
%       c = speedSoundWater(T)
%
% INPUTS:
%       T   - water temperature [degC]
%
% OUTPUTS:
%       c   - speed of sound [m/s]
