function kgrid = makeGrid(varargin)
%MAKEGRID   Create k-space grid.
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%       makeGrid creates an object of the kWaveGrid class containing the
%       grid coordinates and wavenumber matrices used in k-Wave
%       simulations. The grid structures are indexed as: (x, 1) in 1D; 
%       (x, y) in 2D; and (x, y, z) in 3D.   
%
%       Note, for older versions of MATLAB in which custom class
%       definitions are not supported, makeGrid returns a MATLAB grid
%       structure with the same fields. This structure requires additional
%       memory compared to an object of the kWaveGrid class.   
%
% USAGE:
%       kgrid = makeGrid(Nx, dx)
%       kgrid = makeGrid(Nx, dx, Ny, dy)
%       kgrid = makeGrid(Nx, dx, Ny, dy, Nz, dz)
%
% INPUTS:
%       Nx, Ny, Nz  - number of grid points in each Cartesian direction
%       dx, dy, dz  - grid point spacing in each Cartesian direction [m]
%
% OUTPUTS:
%       kgrid       - k-Wave grid structure used by the simulation and
%                     reconstructions functions within k-Wave
%
%       This has the following properties:
%
%       kgrid.k       - ND grid of the scalar wavenumber
%       kgrid.k_max   - maximum spatial frequency supported by the grid
%       kgrid.t_array - evenly spaced array of time values (set to 'auto')
%       kgrid.Nt      - number of time steps (set to 'auto')
%       kgrid.dt      - time step [s] (set to 'auto')
%       kgrid.dim     - number of spatial dimensions
%       kgrid.total_grid_points - total number of grid points
%
%       And for each spatial dimension x, y, z:
%
%       kgrid.Nx      - number of grid points
%       kgrid.dx      - grid point spacing [m]
%       kgrid.x       - plaid ND grid of the x coordinates centered about 0
%                       [m]  
%       kgrid.x_vec   - 1D vector of the x coordinate [m]
%       kgrid.x_size  - length of grid dimension [m]
%       kgrid.kx      - plaid ND grid of the wavenumber components centered
%                       about 0
%       kgrid.kx_vec  - 1D vector of the wavenumber components
%       kgrid.kx_max  - maximum spatial frequency supported by the grid in
%                       the x direction
