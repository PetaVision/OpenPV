grabcut.cxx is a simple commandline interface to the GrabCut image segmentation algorithm that is part of OpenCV.

To build grabcut.cxx:

- install cmake and OpenCV.
- run:
        ccmake -G "Unix MakeFiles"
        	(press c)
        	(press e if no error messages)
        	(press c)
        	(press g)	
        make

You should then be able to execute ./grabcut from the commandline.  grabcut.py is a python script that automates generation of initialization mask images and calling the grabcut binary.
