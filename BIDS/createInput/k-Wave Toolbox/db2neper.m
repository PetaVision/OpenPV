function alpha = db2neper(alpha, y)
%DB2NEPER   Convert decibels to nepers.
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%       db2neper converts an attenuation coefficient in units of
%       dB/(MHz^y cm) to units of Nepers/((rad/s)^y m).
%
% USAGE:
%       alpha = db2neper(alpha)
%       alpha = db2neper(alpha, y)
%
% INPUTS:
%       alpha       - attenuation in dB/(MHz^y cm)
%
% OPTIONAL INPUTS:
%       y           - power law exponent (default = 1)
%
% OUTPUTS:
%       alpha       - attenuation in Nepers/((rad/s)^y m)
