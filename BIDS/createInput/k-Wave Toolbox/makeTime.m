function [t_array, dt] = makeTime(kgrid, c, cfl, t_end)
%MAKETIME   Create an evenly spaced array of time points.
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%       makeTime creates an evenly spaced array of time points for use with
%       the k-Wave simulation codes based on the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy
%       stability level cfl and the grid size. The time-step dt is chosen
%       based on the cfl level (the default setting is 0.3), and the number
%       of time-steps is chosen based on the time it takes to travel from
%       one corner of the grid specified by kgrid to the geometrically
%       opposite corner. Note, if c is given as a matrix, the calculation
%       for dt is based on the maximum value. 
%
% POSSIBLE USAGE:
%       [t_array, dt] = makeTime(kgrid, c)
%       [t_array, dt] = makeTime(kgrid, c, cfl)
%       [t_array, dt] = makeTime(kgrid, c, cfl, t_end)
%       [t_array, dt] = makeTime(kgrid, c, [], t_end)
%
% INPUTS:
%       kgrid       - k-Wave grid structure returned by makeGrid
%       c           - maximum sound speed in the medium [m/s]
%
% OPTIONAL INPUTS:
%       cfl         - Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy stability criterion 
%                     (default = 0.3)
%       t_end       - maximum time [s]
%
% OUTPUTS:
%       t_array     - array of evenly-spaced time points [s]
%       dt          - time step [s]

% CHANGE LOG:
% 2009/10/05    - changed pixel_dim to select min pixel size instead of max
% 2010/04/09    - added tmax input
% 2011/07/19    - updated with reordered inputs
