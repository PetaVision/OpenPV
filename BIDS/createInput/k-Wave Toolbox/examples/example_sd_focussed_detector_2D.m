% Focussed Detector Example in 2D
%
% This example shows how k-Wave can be used to model the output of a
% focussed bowl detector where the directionality arises from spatially
% averaging across the detector surface. It builds on the Homogeneous
% Propagation Medium and Using A Binary Sensor Mask examples.

Nx = 180;           % number of grid points in the x (row) direction
Ny = 180;           % number of grid points in the y (column) direction
dx = 0.1e-3;        % grid point spacing in the x direction [m]
dy = 0.1e-3;        % grid point spacing in the y direction [m]
kgrid = makeGrid(Nx, dx, Ny, dy);

% define the properties of the propagation medium
medium.sound_speed = 1500;    % [m/s]

% define a sensor as part of a circle centred on the grid
sensor_radius = 65; % [grid points]
arc_angle = pi;     % [rad]
sensor.mask = makeCircle(Nx, Ny, Nx/2, Ny/2, sensor_radius, arc_angle);

% define the array of temporal points [s] and shorten it to make the
% example finish sooner
[kgrid.t_array, dt] = makeTime(kgrid, medium.sound_speed);
kgrid.t_array = (0:round(length(kgrid.t_array)*0.75))*dt;

% place a disc-shaped source near the focus of the detector
source.p0 = makeDisc(Nx, Ny, Nx/2, Ny/2, 4)*2;

% run the first simulation
sensor_data1 = kspaceFirstOrder2D(kgrid, medium, source, sensor);

% place a disc-shaped source away from the focus of the detector
source.p0 = makeDisc(Nx, Ny, Nx/2, Ny/2+20, 4)*2;

% run the second simulation
sensor_data2 = kspaceFirstOrder2D(kgrid, medium, source, sensor);

% average the outputs of the simulations over the points making up the sensor
sensor_output1 = sum(sensor_data1,1)/sum(sensor.mask(:));
