function enforceFields(structure, field_names)
%ENFORCEFIELDS   Checks structure field names for existance.
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%       enforceFields checks a MATLAB structure for the existance of a set
%       of required field name defined by a cell array. If a field name
%       within the cell array is not found within the structure, an error
%       is thrown with the name of the missing field given in the error
%       message. The function is useful for enforcing a set of required
%       fields within a structure.
%
% USAGE:
%       enforceFields(structure, field_names)
%
% INPUTS:
%       structure   - MATLAB structure
%       field_names - cell array of allowable field names
