function c_kk = powerLawKramersKronig(w, w0, c0, a0, y)
%POWERLAWKRAMERSKRONIG  Calculate dispersion for power law absorption.
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%       powerLawKramersKronig computes the variation in sound speed for an
%       attenuating medium using the Kramers-Kronig for power law
%       attenuation where att = a0*w^y. The power law parameters must be in
%       Nepers / m, with the frequency in rad/s. The variation is given
%       about the sound speed c0 at a reference frequency w0.
%
% USAGE:
%       c_kk = powerLawKramersKronig(w, w0, c0, a0, y)
%
% INPUTS:
%       w   - input frequency array [rad/s]
%       w0  - reference frequency [rad/s]
%       c0  - sound speed at w0 [m/s]
%       a0  - power law coefficient [Nepers/((rad/s)^y m)]
%       y   - power law exponent
%
% OUTPUTS:
%       c_kk - variation of sound speed with w [m/s]
