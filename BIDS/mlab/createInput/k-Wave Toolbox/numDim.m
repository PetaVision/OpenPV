function dim = numDim(x)
%NUMDIM   Return the number of matrix dimensions.
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%       numDim returns the number of dimensions of a matrix x. Unlike
%       the inbuilt ndims, numDim returns 1 for 1D vectors, 2 for 2D
%       arrays, etc. 
%
% USAGE:
%       dim = numDim(x)
%
% INPUTS:
%       x           - matrix with unknown number of dimensions
%
% OUTPUTS:
%       dim         - number of dimensions
