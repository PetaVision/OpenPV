install vmware fusion 

(this can be done for free via ESD but I'm not using that method here)

get vmware fusion for OSX at 
http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/fusion-evaluation.html

30 day free trial or buy for $100

get CentOS 6.5 

download at
http://wiki.centos.org/Download
http://centos.corenetworks.net/6.5/isos/x86_64/
CentOS-6.5-x86_64-bin-DVD1.iso   
CentOS-6.5-x86_64-bin-DVD2.iso   

these files are several GIGA bytes, download can take a while...

7.0 is available but I was told to download 6.5 so I'm just following instructions...perhaps 6.5 is more stable?
