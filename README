Petavision may be obtained from sourceforge.net using the subversion command:

    svn co https://petavision.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/petavision/trunk petavision
    
You should also check out one of the example projects, for example:

    svn co https://petavision.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/petavision/examples/CellularAutomata ca
    
If you want to use a branch (for example, the hyperstructure branch):

    svn co https://petavision.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/petavision/branches/hyperstructure petavision
    
From Eclipse, use the SVN Repository Perspective and:
   1. Right click in the SVN Repositories window
   2. Select new->Repository Location
   3. Enter https://petavision.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/petavision for the URL
      a. Double click on petavision repository 
      b. Double click on trunk or branches
   4. Right click on the trunk or the branch you want and choose the checkout command
      a. accept the defaults and click Finish
    
Petavision should build correctly within Eclipse as soon as it is installed using
the SVN checkout command (for 64 bit architectures, please see the INSTALL file).

To run the application using Eclipse you must create a Run Configuration:
   1. Click on the arrow just to the right of the debug or run icons:
   2. Select Run Configurations... from the menu.
   3. Click on the C/C++ Local Application
   4. Click on the New button (left-most icon in the upper panel):
      a. Fill in Name:
      b. Select a project if not automatically entered (you may need to Browse for it)
      c. Select an application (you may need to Search Project or Browse for it)
   5. Select the arguments tab
      a. add command line arguments (for example: -n 2 -p input/inparams.txt -i input/const_one_64x64.tif)

One a Run Configuration is setup you can debug or run PetaVision by clicking on the
debug or run icons.

To build petavision without Eclipse:
   1. cd to the root project directory
   2. Type make (this will make src/pv_example and src/build/libpv.a)

To run petavision without Eclipse:
   1. cd to the root project directory
   2. Type src/pv_example -n 2 -p input/inparams.txt -i input/const_one_64x64.tif
   
To run one of the examples (using make to build):
   1. First make the PetaVision library (see above)
   2. cd to the example directory that you want to build
   3. Type make
   4. pv_ca -n 500 -p input/params.pv -i input/one-pixel.tif

NOTE: There may be other more complete applications (e.g., pv.cpp) other than
pv_example.cpp in the primary PetaVision project directory.  To build and run
these files from Eclipse you will need to edit the files and add #define HAS_MAIN
to the file.  If there is more than one main within a project, Eclipse will whine.
