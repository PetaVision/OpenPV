===== INSTALL MERMAID =====

1) Download the ‘node’ .pkg file from https://nodejs.org and allow your OS to install it normally.

2) Once node is installed, open a terminal and enter the following commands:

	> sudo npm install -g mermaid
	> sudo npm install -g phantomjs

3) Mermaid will interpret plain text files and output .png files. To test your install, you can create a test document with the following text:

	graph TB;
	a -—> b;

4) Enter the following commands:

	> mermaid your_test_file
	> open your_test_file.png

5) This should create and display a png with the same name as your text file, displaying a simple flowchart. 

===== DRAWING A DIAGRAM =====

Once you have mermaid installed, you can use the bash script “draw,” located in PetaVision/plab, to automatically generate .png diagrams of your params files.

1) The next step is to include this script in your bash source paths. Open your .bash_profile file in your home directory and look for the line that begins “export PATH”— This is an environmental variable that can take a colon-separated list, and you want to add the path to PetaVision’s plab folder to this list. When you’ve done this the line might look something like this:

	export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH:~/your/path/to/PetaVision/plab

Then from the command line, run

	> source .bash_profile


2) You might have to change permissions on the script to run it. From a terminal command line, enter:

	> chmod 500 ~/your/path/to/PetaVision/plab/draw

To confirm this setup has worked,

	> which draw

Should print /your/path/to/PetaVision/plab/draw

3) To generate a diagram, cd to any directory containing a params file and enter:

	> draw your_file.params

4) To run the version of the diagram generator which includes more text information, repeat the above two steps replacing ‘draw’ with ‘infodraw’.

Linking nodejs to node seems to fix a apt-get install error with Ubuntu (assuming you have both downloaded with install apt-get)
