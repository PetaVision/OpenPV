This file contains a description of the usage of the scale factor
between layers.

The scale factor is a measure of the difference in distance scales between
layers.  The distance scale, dx, is the distance between neurons in
retinatopic units so dx in the retina is 1.

In the PV code, the scale factor is usually stored as log base 2 of the
relative scale factor.  Thus if xScaleLog2 == 1 for a layer, then dx == 2
(the linear density of neurons is 1/2 that of the retina).  Likewise if
xScaleLog2 == -1, then dx == 1/2 (the linear density of the neurons is 2 times
that of the retina).
