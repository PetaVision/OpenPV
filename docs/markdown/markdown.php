#Markdown documentation using [Parsedown](http://parsedown.org/)
-------------

To keep all documentation centrally location, some of the documentation pages
on this website were generated using markdown text hosted on sourceforge.



## Quick tips

* To make a new paragraph, make sure to include an extra 
return between the lines (this isn't necessary with lists)
* When writing in code use and apostrophe 'like this' to get text formatted 
* The number of pound symbols you use determines the number of the header h1, h2, h3 etc.

### This is a third level header

* To add a link, use square brackets for the link text, and parenthesies for the url.
* For example, I used the PHP application[Parsedown](http://parsedown.org/demo?example=bootstrap_readme)
to convert this text into a document.
