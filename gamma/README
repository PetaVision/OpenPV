About:
   This code is attempting to implement a context-free method of analyzing images (so far 
   only implemented in the 1-dimensional direction)


To check out the repositories from Eclipse you must first install the Subclipse plug-in.
   1. Right click in the SVN Repositories window
   2. Select New -> Repository Location
   3. Enter "https://petavision.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/petavision" for the URL
      a. Double click on PetaVision repository 
      b. Double click on trunk and the examples
   4. Right click on the trunk and the example you want and choose the checkout command
      a. accept the defaults and click Finish

In Eclipse to run the craig sandbox:
First, you must build the PetaVision library
   1. Right click on PetaVision
   2. Select Build Configurations -> Set Active -> 2 lib (Library)
   3. Go to the Project menu and select "Build All"
Second, you have to build the craig sandbox. The dependencies to the PetaVision code should
already be set up if the default settings were selected during checkout.
   Go to the Project menu and select "Build All"
Finally, to run the code:
   1. Right click on craig
   2. Select Run as -> Run configurations...
   3. Set up the hierarchy run configurations, click on the "Arguments" tab and type
      "-n 2000 -p input/params.pv"

Settings:
   -n   number of runs
   -i   the path to the input file
   -p   the path to the paramaters file


Petavision may be obtained from sourceforge.net using the subversion command:

    svn co https://petavision.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/petavision/trunk petavision
    
You should also check out one of the example projects, (this project, for example):

    svn co https://petavision.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/petavision/sandbox/craig craig
    

First you must build the PetaVision library:
   1. cd to the root petavision project directory
   2. Type make (this will build petavision/src/build/libpv.a)

To run one of the examples (this project, for example):
   1. First make the PetaVision library (see above)
   2. cd to the example directory that you want to build
   3. Type make
   4. pv_ca -n 500 -p input/params.pv -i input/one-pixel.tif

NOTE: There may be other more complete applications (e.g., pv.cpp) other than
pv_example.cpp in the primary PetaVision project directory.  To build and run
these files from Eclipse you will need to edit the files and add #define HAS_MAIN
to the file.  If there is more than one main within a project, Eclipse will whine.
