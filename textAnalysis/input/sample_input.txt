Wireless networks of biologically inspired distributed sensors (BIDS) are hypothesized to enable improved overall detection accuracy using ultra-low power and low bandwidth spike-based communication between nodes. Unlike traditional sensor networks, in which nodes communicate via digital protocols that require precise decoding of binary signal packets, BIDS nodes communicate by broadcasting generic radio frequency pulses, or spikes. Individual BIDS nodes are modeled after leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons, in which both filtered sensory signals and inputs from other BIDS nodes are accumulated as capacitive charge that decays with a characteristic time constant. A BIDS node itself broadcasts a spike whenever its internal state exceeds a threshold value. Here we present detailed simulations of a BIDS network designed to detect a moving target--modeled as a pure acoustic tone with a translating origin--against a background of 1/f noise. In the absence of a target, the average internal state is well below threshold and noise-induced spikes recruit little additional activity. In contrast, the presence of a target pushes the average internal state closer to threshold, such that each spike is now able to recruit additional spikes, leading to a chain reaction. Our results show that while individual BIDS nodes may be noisy and unreliable, a network of BIDS nodes is capable of highly reliable detection even when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) on individual nodes is low. We demonstrate that collective computation between nodes supports improved detection accuracy in a manner that is extremely robust to the damage or loss of individual nodes.

There is a need for cheap sensors that are robust, energy efficient, and easy to deploy as an ad-hoc network for monitoring large, remote, and often inaccessible areas. Such a network should be infinitely scalable and robust to failing sensors Estrin et. al. In a typical scenario, the sensor network could be tasked with notifying an outside observer of the presence and approximate location of a particular target. One such scenario is monitoring the security of national borders by detecting people and vehicles. Conventional distributed sensor network (DSN) nodes require abundant bandwidth to communicate to a global hub where information is integrated to make a detection decision. The bandwidth required for many nodes to communicate to a single central computer or cluster head can be prohibitive and have considerable power requirements Heinzelman et. al. Moreover, the expense of the hardware required to allow such communication protocols is not feasible for deployment over large, remote areas Estrin et. al.. Here we propose a solution to such a remote monitoring problem with Biologically Inspired Distributed Sensors (BIDS). BIDS nodes are designed to be inexpensive enough to be distributed liberally across a wide area and able to be configured into a topology that is resilient to changes, such as nodes failing or new nodes entering. Because BIDS nodes use biologically motivated spike-based communication and simple analog components, they would consume significantly less power than a conventional DSN node that uses digital communication protocols. Thus, BIDS nodes could potentially be powered by scavenged resources, such as solar energy collected from cheap photovoltaic panels.

Individual BIDS sensors are expected to have a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) because of the need to make them small, cheap, and low power, which allows deployment over large, remote regions. However, the dynamics of the BIDS network can greatly improve the SNR through collective computation. To enable these dynamics, the individual BIDS node is modeled after a leaky-integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron (Worgotter et. al., Burkitt et. al.). Input to the sensor head increases the internal state potential of a node, which decays with a characteristic time constant. The inputs to the node are summed in parallel, which pushes the node toward a threshold. When the threshold is reached, the node fires an omnidirectional spike (mimicking an action potential in a neuron) represented by a radio-frequency (RF) pulse. The nodes within a given radius detect the spike, which increases their internal state potential. This form of communication is inspired by the concept of synaptic interactions between biological neurons. Whereas synaptic interactions between biological neurons can be either excitatory or inhibitory, depending on whether the resulting input drives the internal state closer or further away from threshold, interactions between BIDS nodes are purely excitatory and thus always act to produce an overall increase in excitation across the network. When one BIDS node fires a spike, it brings all the other BIDS nodes within its communication radius closer to their firing thresholds. If no target is present, and thus the individual sensor heads are responding solely to environmental noise, most nodes will be far from threshold and the net effect of any single spike will be negligible (i.e. unlikely to elicit any additional spikes). On the other hand, if a target is present, such that the individual sensor heads over some stimulated region are all receiving additional drive, then more of the nodes in the local network will be close to threshold and any single spike can elicit multiple additional spikes. Thus, the presence or absence of a target determines whether any single spike evokes a chain reaction, thereby causing a large general increase in firing activity across the stimulated portion of the network. In this way, even a relatively weak target signal can be amplified by collective interactions, producing a much more detectable signal with a much higher SNR. Here we will describe communication between BIDS nodes (RF pulses) as lateral interactions in order to distinguish them from the internal communication from the sensor head that is detecting the raw stimulus.

BIDS networks are scalable, robust and fault tolerant because each individual node performs local computations to determine if a detection has occurred. Because each BIDS node operates in a self-contained fashion, integrating its sensor input with generic input from surrounding nodes, the network can be extended or augmented simply by adding additional nodes. The individual nodes within a BIDS network do not need to communicate to a central computer, which greatly lowers bandwidth requirements and alleviates the need for complex communication protocols to deal with collisions and changing topologies due to damage, node loss, and other factors. The extremely simple and robust spike-based communication protocol also replaces the need for a MAC protocol Chaari. These latter two points also give evidence that the BIDS nodes will have lower power requirements. Additionally, it has been well established that neuromorphic hardware requires substantially less power than digital hardware.

The focus of this work is to model a mechanism for a BIDS network to detect a signal reliably in spite of low signal-to-noise due to poor individual detectors and environment noise. This is accomplished through collective computation via interactions between the nodes. Although we will touch on proposed hardware and communication mechanisms, there are no fixed specifications for the individual nodes.

Others have demonstrated a capability for high coverage, low power, inexpensive, and robust DSNs. To achieve high coverage, Howard presented mobile nodes that repel other nodes and obstacles to spread coverage with minimal nodes. This facilitates a large network coverage by distributing the sensor nodes as sparsely as possible. Although BIDS nodes are currently designed to obviate the need for mobile nodes, the algorithm and architecture can be used in mobile nodes to reduce the overall operating power.

Power considerations were explored in Zhang et. al, which argues that a dense network of nodes is detrimental to the network in several ways. The problem was alleviated by choosing a subset of the network's nodes to stay on for low power usage. We argue that multiple nodes with cheap hardware can achieve better detections as a dense network than as a sparse network. A dense network also reduces power consumption for each individual node because of low transmission range requirements.

Other work has explored the insight biology gives into dynamic networking, self-calibration, and peer to peer communications by modeling ants Theraulaz et. al., cells \cite{hayes:1}, fireflies Wokoma et. al., and bees Boonma. Specifically, Boonma et. al. presented modeling biological behaviors such as ``energy exchange, pheromone emission, replication, migration and death'' to achieve autonomous, scalable, adaptable, self-healing, and simplistic networks. Similarly, we propose a DSN that models a network of neurons to achieve detections by exploiting a local, embedded algorithm.

Other research done by Estrin et. al. and Intanagonwiwat et. al. is closely related to what BIDS is trying to accomplish. Estrin et. al. looks into local algorithms and a data-centric network. It is argued that each node does not need an identity to be useful to the network. This allows for a robust network that is resilient to topological changes. Directed diffusion Intanagonwiwat et. al., although local and robust, requires a query-driven data delivery model, as in Akkaya et al. We are looking at a specific scenario of monitoring a large, inaccessible area where a simple detection scheme suffices. We believe that a sensor network with a simple communication protocol will lead to accurate detections for lower costs than Intanagonwiwat et. al. predicts.
