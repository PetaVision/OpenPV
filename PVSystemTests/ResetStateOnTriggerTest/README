ResetStateOnTriggerTest tests the parameter setting
triggerBehavior = "resetStateOnTrigger".

The layers and connections are shown in ResetStateOnTrigger.png.
It is deliberate that TriggerSource and ResettingLayerMovie are each
unconnected to all other layers.

TriggerSource is a movie layer with a display period of five.  The contents
of the movie frames were generated randomly and should have no effect on the
test.  All that matters is that the layer triggers every five timesteps.

ResettingLayerMovie is a movie layer with a display period of three.
It is 8x8x3.  In the first frame, the values are in the range 0..191, and
everytime the image flips the values increase by one.

Input is a constant layer with values all one.

Output is a LeakyIntegrator layer with decay time constant infinity
(i.e. it never decays).  Its triggerLayer is set to TriggerSource,
with triggerBehavior = "resetStateOnTrigger" and triggerResetLayer
set to ResettingLayer.  The connection from input to
output is an IdentConn.

Therefore, Output will increment by one every timestep, with the caveat
that every fifth timestep (t=1, t=6, t=11, t=16), output grabs the values
from ResettingLayer before it increments.

The phases of ResettingLayer and Output are both 1.  Therefore if a trigger
occurs at time t, Output will grab the values of ResettingLayer at the end
of timestep t-1.  The correct behavior is therefore:

The CorrectValues layer is a movie that loads the correct values per the
table above.  The Comparison layer gets Output-CorrectValues as input.
The test fails if any neuron in Comparison is nonzero.  Roundoff should not
be an issue since everything is integer valued in this test.
