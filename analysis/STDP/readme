>  stdp_compAverageWeightsEvol.m for each neuron computes the sum of 
its synapse weights as a fucntion of time.

> stdp_analyzeWeightsRate.m it looks at the average rate versus
average weights. For each neuron, we first compute the sum of its
synaptic weights as a fucntion of time. Then, we average this sum in a
time window and we plot the average rate fro all neurons that have the
average sum of weights in a given bin.


> stdp_plotHistograms.m reads the histograms already computed by
rate.py code. This code runs PV for a sequence of retina background
firing rates. For each rate it computes the average firing rate in L1
and it computes the histogram of synaptic weights.
