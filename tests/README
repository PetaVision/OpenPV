This directory contains system tests for the core PetaVision library.
If you build the tests using the CMakeLists.txt in this directory
(which incorporates the CMakeLists.txt in the test subdirectories 
using CMake's add_subdirectory command), you can run the tests from
this directory using the ctest command.
