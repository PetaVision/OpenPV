Here are the commands to execute.  Similar commands could be
run for the 0002, 0003, etc. directories, but the input .pv
files would need to be changed as well as the commands.
Ideally, the output directory defined in the .pv file would
be used, but that would require changing the PetaVision/src
code in a lot of places. 

Debug/pv -n 484 -p input/params-target-train.pv
mv output/*.* output/target/0001/train/
Debug/pv -n 484 -p input/params-distractor-train.pv
mv output/*.* output/distractor/0001/train/
Debug/pv -n 124 -p input/params-target-test.pv
mv output/*.* output/target/0001/test/
Debug/pv -n 124 -p input/params-distractor-test.pv
mv output/*.* output/target/0001/test/
