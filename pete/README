Petavision may be obtained from sourceforge.net using the subversion command:

    svn checkout http://svn.code.sf.net/p/petavison PetaVision
or
    svn checkout https://USERNAME@svn.code.sf.net/p/petavision PetaVision
where USERNAME is your sourceforge username.

The http version allows you to check out but not to commit (that is, it's read-only);
the https version allows you to commit as well. 
    
You should also check out one of the example projects, (CellularAutomata, for example):

    svn co https://petavision.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/petavision/examples/CellularAutomata ca
    
First build the PetaVision library:
   1. cd to the root petavision project directory
   2. Type make (this will build petavision/src/build/libpv.a)

To run one of the examples (this project, for example):
   1. First make the PetaVision library (see above)
   2. cd to the example directory that you want to build
   3. Type make
   4. pv -n 500 -p input/params.pv -i input/one-pixel.tif

NOTE: There may be other more complete applications (e.g., pv.cpp) other than
pv_example.cpp in the primary PetaVision project directory.  To build and run
these files from Eclipse you will need to edit the files and add #define HAS_MAIN
to the file.  If there is more than one main within a project, Eclipse will whine.
