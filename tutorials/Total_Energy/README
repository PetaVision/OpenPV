The Total_Energy_Demo demonstrates using GenColProbe and subclasses of
LayerFunctionProbe to compute the total energy of a simple soft-threshold LCA
model.

Total_Energy_Demo.png shows the connectivity defined by the params file
input/Total_Energy_Demo.params.  V1 is a HyPerLCA layer with a soft threshold of
VThresh = 0.025.  Therefore the LCA dynamics minimize the energy

1/2 * || x-Wy ||_2^2 + 0.025 * || y ||_1.

x is the input layer, y is the V1 layer and W is the matrix of connection weights.
Hence R = x-Wy is the residual.

||.||_2 represents the L2 norm and ||.||_1 represents the L1 norm.

The LayerFunctionProbe class in pv-core is an abstract class derived from
LayerProbe, that computes a statistic for its targeLayer.  The statistics we
are interested in are 1/2 * || R ||_2^2 and ||y||_1.

The L2NormProbe class in pv-core is a derived class of LayerFunctionProbe that
computes 1/2 * || R ||_2^2 (it is therefore misnamed, since it's computing half
the square instead of the norm itself).

To compute ||y||_1 we need a new class.  Accordingly, we create a class
L1NormProbe that computes the L1-norm instead the L2-norm-based quantity.
LayerFunctionProbes require a LayerFunction object so we also have define
a class L1NormFunction used by L1NormProbe.

The GenColProbe class in pv-core allows LayerFunctionProbe objects
to register themselves with it, and computes the sum of the probes' stats,
weighted by coefficients defined in the params for the LayerFunctionProbe.

Thus, the following probe groups in input/Total_Energy_Demo.params
compute the total energy at each timestep, and writes the energy
to total_energy.txt in the output path directory:

GenColProbe "Total_Energy_Probe" = {
    probeOutputFile                     = "total_energy.txt";
};

L2NormProbe "Reconstruction_Error_Probe" = {
    targetLayer                         = "residual";
    probeOutputFile                     = "recon_error_l2norm.txt";
    parentGenColProbe                   = "Total_Energy_Probe";
    coeff                               = 1.0;
};

L1NormProbe "Sparsity_Penalty_Probe" = {
    targetLayer                         = "V1";
    probeOutputFile                     = "sparsity_penalty.txt";
    parentGenColProbe                   = "Total_Energy_Probe";
    coeff                               = 0.025;
};
