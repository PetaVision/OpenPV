# Sample subdirectories.txt file.
# A file called subdirectories.txt is used by CMakeLists.txt to specify
# the directories to pass to add_subdirectory commands.
# 
# Comments begin with '#'
PVSystemTests  # comments can follow the subdirectory
  
# Empty lines and lines containing only whitespace are ignored.
auxlib/mlearning
   auxlib/mlearning/tests   # Leading and trailing whitespace is ignored
projects/HyPerHLCA

# The above is processed exactly the same as the following would be
# (without the leading '#' on each line):
#PVSystemTests
#auxlib/mlearning
#auxlib/mlearning/tests
#projects/HyPerHLCA
