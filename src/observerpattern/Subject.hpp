 * behavior of the objects in the hierarchy, and the meaning of the notify() method's return values.

   /**
    * This method calls the respond() method of each object in the given table, using the given
    * vector of messages. If the table consists of objects A, B, and C; and the messages vector
    * consists of messages X and Y, the order is
    * A->X,
    * A->Y,
    * B->X,
    * B->Y,
    * C->X,
    * C->Y.
    *
    * The objects' respond() method returns one of the Response::Status types:
    * SUCCESS, NO_ACTION, PARTIAL, or PV_POSTPONE.
    *
    * SUCCESS: the object completed the task requested by the messages.
    * NO_ACTION: the object has nothing to do in response to the message, or had already done it.
    * PARTIAL: the object has not yet completed but is making progress. It is expected that
    * there are a small number of descrete tasks, so that an object will not return PARTIAL
    * a large number of times in response to the same message.
    * POSTPONE: the object needs to act but cannot do so until an event outside its control occurs.
    *
    * If all objects return NO_ACTION, then notify() returns NO_ACTION.
    * If all objects return either SUCCESS or NO_ACTION and there is at least one SUCCESS,
    * then notify() returns SUCCESS.
    * If all objects return either POSTPONE or NO_ACTION and there is at least one POSTPONE,
    * then notify() returns POSTPONE.
    * Otherwise, notify() returns PARTIAL.
    *
    * Generally each message in the messages vector is sent to each object in the table.
    * However, if an object returns POSTPONE in response to a message, the loop skips to
    * the next object, and does not sent any remaining messages to the postponing object.
    *
    * The rationale behind these rules is so that if the objects in the table are themselves
    * derived from the Subject class, the messages can be passed down the tree and the
    * return values passed up it, and the return value at the top can be interpreted as being
    * over all the components at the bottom, without the topmost object needing to know
    * details of the composition of the objects below it.
    *
    * If printFlag is true, the method prints information regarding postponement to standard output.
