 * ColumnEnergyProbe assembles several base probes each of which
 * contribute a term to an energy of the entire HyPerCol.
 *
 * At the params file level, define a ColumnEnergyProbe group.  Say,
 * for example that the group is named "total_energy".  Then for each base
 * probe you want to add to the probe, its params should include the line
 *
 * energyProbe = "total_energy";
 *
 * Then optionally specify a coefficient, which defaults to 1.
 *
 * The contribution from this probe to the total energy is
 * coefficient * value
 * where value is the result of calling the BaseProbe's getValues() method.
 *
 * At the C/C++ code level, BaseProbes register themselves to the
 * ColumnEnergyProbe by calling the ColumnEnergyProbe's addTerm() method.
 * Each call to a ColumnEnergyProbe's object that calls addTerm() must
 * have the same getNumValues() value, which becomes the ColumnEnergyProbe's
 * getNumValues() value.
